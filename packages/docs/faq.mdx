Answers to common questions about lazyff.

## General

### What is lazyff?

lazyff is a command-line tool that wraps ffmpeg, providing a simpler interface for common video and audio operations. Instead of memorizing complex ffmpeg commands, you can use intuitive commands like `lazyff convert`, `lazyff compress`, etc.

### Why use lazyff instead of ffmpeg directly?

**lazyff advantages:**
- Simpler syntax for common operations
- Sensible defaults (codecs, quality, etc.)
- Human-readable error messages with suggestions
- Interactive TUI mode
- No need to memorize ffmpeg flags

**When to use ffmpeg directly:**
- Advanced/custom operations
- Fine-grained control over every parameter
- Operations lazyff doesn't support

### Is lazyff free?

Yes, lazyff is free and open source. It's released under the MIT license.

### What platforms does lazyff support?

lazyff works on:
- macOS
- Linux (all major distributions)
- Windows (via PowerShell or WSL)

### Does lazyff require ffmpeg?

Yes, lazyff is a wrapper around ffmpeg. You must have ffmpeg installed and available in your PATH.

## Installation

### How do I install lazyff?

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)

## Usage

### How do I convert a video?

```bash
lazyff convert input.mov output.mp4
```

See the [convert command](/commands/convert) for all options.

### How do I compress a video to a specific size?

```bash
lazyff compress video.mp4 --target-size 25MB
```

See the [compress command](/commands/compress) for all options.

### How do I trim a video?

```bash
lazyff trim video.mp4 --start 00:01:00 --duration 30
```

See the [trim command](/commands/trim) for all options.

### How do I create a GIF?

```bash
lazyff gif video.mp4 --start 5 --duration 3 --width 480
```

See the [gif command](/commands/gif) for all options.

### How do I extract audio from a video?

```bash
lazyff extract video.mp4 --audio
```

See the [extract command](/commands/extract) for all options.

### What formats does lazyff support?

lazyff supports all formats that ffmpeg supports, including:
- Video: MP4, WebM, MKV, MOV, AVI, and more
- Audio: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, and more

See the [Formats reference](/reference/formats) for details.

### What codecs does lazyff support?

lazyff supports major codecs including:
- Video: H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1
- Audio: AAC, MP3, Opus, FLAC

See the [Codecs reference](/reference/codecs) for details.

## Quality & Size

### What quality preset should I use?

| Preset     | When to use                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `low`      | Previews, drafts, when size is critical |
| `medium`   | General use, social media (default)     |
| `high`     | Final delivery, archiving               |
| `lossless` | Professional work, source for editing   |

### Why is my output larger than input?

This can happen when:
1. Upscaling resolution
2. Using higher quality preset
3. Converting to less efficient codec
4. Very short clips (fixed overhead)

Use `lazyff compress --target-size` for size control.

### How do I get the smallest file size?

```bash
# Use compress with target size
lazyff compress video.mp4 --target-size 10MB

# Or use low quality preset with lower resolution
lazyff convert video.mp4 output.mp4 -q low -r 480p
```

### How do I get the best quality?

```bash
# Use high or lossless quality preset
lazyff convert video.mp4 output.mp4 -q high

# For perfect quality (very large files)
lazyff convert video.mp4 output.mp4 -q lossless
```

## Technical

### Does lazyff re-encode files?

By default, yes. lazyff re-encodes to ensure quality and compatibility.

To avoid re-encoding (faster but less flexible):
```bash
lazyff convert input.mkv output.mp4 --video-codec copy --audio-codec copy
lazyff trim video.mp4 --start 10 --duration 5 --copy
```

### Can I use lazyff in scripts?

Yes! The CLI mode is fully scriptable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.mov; do
  lazyff convert "$file" "${file%.mov}.mp4"
done
```

### Does lazyff support batch processing?

Not directly in a single command, but you can use shell scripting:

```bash
# Convert all MOV files to MP4
for f in *.mov; do lazyff convert "$f" -f mp4; done

# Compress all MP4 files
for f in *.mp4; do lazyff compress "$f" -s 25MB; done
```

### Can I see the ffmpeg command lazyff runs?

Currently, lazyff doesn't expose the underlying ffmpeg command. This feature may be added in a future release.

As a workaround, you can use `ffmpeg -hide_banner` with verbose flags to see what parameters are typically used.

## TUI

### What is the TUI?

TUI stands for Terminal User Interface. It's an interactive mode that guides you through operations with menus, prompts, and visual feedback.

Launch it by running `lazyff` without any arguments.

### When should I use CLI vs TUI?

**Use CLI when:**
- You know exactly what you want
- Writing scripts
- Quick one-off commands

**Use TUI when:**
- Exploring features
- Learning lazyff
- Prefer visual guidance

### Can I customize the TUI theme?

Yes. Theme selection is controlled via a config file:

- Edit `~/.config/lazyff/config.json`.
- Set `theme` to one of the built-in theme names (for example `"tokyonight"`, `"dracula"`, `"nord"`).
- Optionally set `mode` to `"dark"` or `"light"`.

The TUI will load this theme on startup.

## Troubleshooting

### lazyff says "command not found"

The binary isn't in your PATH. See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#command-not-found-lazyff).

### lazyff says "ffmpeg not found"

ffmpeg isn't installed or not in PATH. See [Installation](/installation#step-2-install-ffmpeg).

### My file won't convert

Check:
1. File exists and isn't corrupted
2. You have read/write permissions
3. Disk space available
4. Run `lazyff info file.mp4` to check the file

See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) for more solutions.
