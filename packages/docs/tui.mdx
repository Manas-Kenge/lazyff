ffwrap includes an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) that provides a guided experience for media operations.

## Launching the TUI

Simply run ffwrap without any command:

```bash
ffwrap
```

## Basic Usage

### Layout and Workflow

The TUI is organized into three main areas:

- **Left panel**: File tree for browsing and selecting media files.
- **Middle panel**: **Activity** stream showing operations, progress, and results.
- **Right panel**: Media info/preview (hidden automatically on narrow terminals).

Most operations are started from the **file tree** using **single-key shortcuts** once a file is selected.

### File Selection

- Use the arrow keys (or your terminal’s navigation keys) to move through the file tree.
- Press `Enter` on a directory to expand/enter it.
- Press `Enter` on a file to select it; available operations for that file will be shown in the footer.

### Command Shortcuts

When a file is selected, you can trigger operations directly with single-key shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Show media info for selected file |
| `c` | Open **Compress** dialog |
| `v` | Open **Convert** dialog |
| `e` | Open **Extract** dialog |
| `g` | Open **GIF** dialog |
| `r` | Open **Trim** dialog |
| `t` | Open **Thumbnail** dialog |
| `m` | Open **Merge** dialog (pick additional files to merge) |

Each action opens a small dialog to choose options; progress and results are streamed into the **Activity** panel.

### Global Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+P` | Open help dialog |
| `Esc` | Close current dialog / cancel operation |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit ffwrap |

See the full [Shortcuts](/reference/shortcuts) reference for all keyboard controls.

## Themes

The TUI supports multiple color themes. Theme selection is **config-based**:

- Edit your config file at `~/.config/ffwrap/config.json`.
- Set the `theme` field to one of the built-in theme names.
- Optionally set `mode` to `"dark"` or `"light"`.

Example:

```json
{
  "theme": "tokyonight",
  "mode": "dark"
}
```
